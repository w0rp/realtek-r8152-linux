# RTL8152/RTL8153 kernel module

This repo has a version of the source code for the RTL8152/RTL8153 kernel module
which happens to work on my small Debian server machine and with this specific
TECKNET USB Ethernet adapter that I use: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003EDY97A

Pretty much none of the work here is mine. See the copywrite notices in
individual files for the authors of the files.
